Battletech Advanced 3062 currently features over 2,400 'Mech variants in total.

Below you will find an alphabetically sorted list of 'Mechs, divided by weight class, a list of all variants, and their weight, hardpoints, and stock role, for a very rough look at its power at a glance. All mechs have their total hardpoints listed rather than their default configuration's used hardpoints.

| Free Tonnage: || 
* Core Gear: With the exception of the engine, core, e-cooling and gyro (i.e. anything in the CT core gear), all non-fixed equipment and armor is stripped to give a free tonnage value. This is the default free tonnage measurement for OmniMechs with locked gear.
* Bare: All components and armor are stripped. This shows the weight taken up by structure and gives a broader idea of total free tonnage on BattleMechs
